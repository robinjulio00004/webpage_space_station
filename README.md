# webpage_space_station
Example Augmented Reality (AR) Webpage made by me with AR.js (AugmentedReality.javascript)

Previously we must generate the model in glTF format and the image & pattern

In this example shows a target (number 43 as target) and space station is displayed

This way is faster than other (ARWT, Zappar, Unity, neddle,etc.) 

I've seen Zappar or Unity with ARWT code and All use AR.js as core for that reason but it is also more difficult to learn

Obviusly the results are the best. :)
